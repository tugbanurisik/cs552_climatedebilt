This study explores the potential of Linear Regression (LR) as an alternative method to uncover dynamics between climatic variables and predict Heating Degree Days (HDD) using historical data of Dutch Province De Bilt spanning 1800-2014. The research question addresses whether LR can effectively model the complex relationships in given climate data and predict the HDD. The study identifies multicollinearity and overfitting as key issues in initial models, mitigated through feature selection techniques, including Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis and Backward Elimination. The final modelâ€™s performance metrics show a significant improvement in balance between training and test results as R-Score for training set is 0.98 and the test set is 0.89 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for training set is 220.34 and for test set is 987.12, justifying the application of LR, which predicts the HDD with a high R-Score.
